# AWS Authenticate

This CLI tool helps you to configure your AWS access in CI/CD environments. You can set the region, the IAM profile to use or assume IAM roles with one CLI call.

The tool prints environment variables to the console to use in subsequent calls. By using `eval` you can set the environment in one call.

## How to install

To install this tool you need NodeJS and NPM installed on your machine.
You can then execute `npm install -g aws-authenticate` to install the `aws-authenticate` executable.

## Examples

### One-liners

To use a profile configured in your `~/.aws/config` file, issue the following command:

`eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --profile myprofile)"`

To assume a role using your default config you call it like:

`eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --role MyRole)"`

To assume a role in another account, use:

`eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --role MyRole --roleAccount 123456789012)"`

To assume a role in another account using a different policy, call:

`eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --role MyRole --roleAccount 123456789012 --roleSessionPolicy 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess')"`

To clear all AWS related environment variable and use the defaults, call:

`eval "$(aws-authenticate clear)"`

### Example using sub-shell

If you do not want to pollute your environment with settings, you can use a sub-shell to only configure AWS for several calls:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

...
(
    eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --profile myprofile)"
    aws s3 ls
)
...
```

### Looping through all accounts

If you want to do something for a accounts in an organization, use the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

export accounts=$(aws-authenticate accounts)

echo "${accounts}" | while read account; do
(
    id=$(echo "${account}" | cut -d ',' -f 1)
    safeName=$(echo "${account}" | cut -d ',' -f 4)
    
    echo "Doing stuff for account ${id} with safe name ${safeName}"

    eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --roleAccount ${id} --role master --region eu-central-1)"

    aws-authenticate set-alias --name "${safeName}"
)

done

```

If you have a tag called `Alias` on your accounts, you can set the account alias with the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

export accounts=$(aws-authenticate accounts --tags Alias)

echo "${accounts}" | while read account; do
(
    id=$(echo "${account}" | cut -d ',' -f 1)
    alias=$(echo "${account}" | cut -d ',' -f 6)
    eval "$(aws-authenticate auth --roleAccount ${id} --role master --region eu-central-1)"
    aws-authenticate set-alias --name "${alias}"
)

done

```
